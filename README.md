## Image quality detection app

### This is an Android app that uses machine learning to check if an image is Sharp or Blurry.

* The way it does this is by selecting an image from the gallery of the phone then it will check if its a Good or Bad image.
* The machine learning model was trained on both Blurry and Sharp image.
